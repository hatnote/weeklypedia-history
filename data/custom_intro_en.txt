Hello and welcome back to Weeklypedia! Mahmoud from Hatnote here to apologize for the service interruption the last couple weeks. I've been way too busy launching FinFam, a wiki-inspired app store of explorable explanations, powered by open-source community spreadsheets. It's my most ambitious project yet, and if you love free knowledge, you may well enjoy FinFam, too.

Let me know if you give it a go! https://finfam.app

PS FinFam has a newsletter, too! https://finfam.app/blog
