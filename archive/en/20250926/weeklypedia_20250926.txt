The WEEKLYPEDIA: Issue 602, September 26, 2025 (English Wikipedia Edition)

Hello and welcome back to Weeklypedia! Mahmoud from Hatnote here to apologize for the service interruption the last couple weeks. I've been way too busy launching FinFam, a wiki-inspired app store of explorable explanations, powered by open-source community spreadsheets. It's my most ambitious project yet, and if you love free knowledge, you may well enjoy FinFam, too.

Let me know if you give it a go! https://finfam.app

PS FinFam has a newsletter, too! https://finfam.app/blog
